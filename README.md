# email-service

simple email service using a firebase function for misc things I want to send emails for.

~~will need a .env and sendgrid creds if you wish to use it, docs here for sendgrid support [here](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/v3-nodejs-code-example/)~~

Sendgrid killed my account and made it way too professional, so using gmail creds now with nodemailer. [nodemailer docs](https://nodemailer.com/about/) and a neat post about using it with firebase [here](https://edigleyssonsilva.medium.com/cloud-functions-for-firebase-sending-e-mail-1f2631d1022e)
